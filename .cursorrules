- Minimize code change, and make small increments to progressively test one feature at a time.
- Ensure no visual elements are changed. Forms or buttons or any layout should not change
- Login by google should be last stage do not make changes for that yet.
- Check if an existing file exists and place the new logic there instead of creating a brand new file as far as needed.
- Keep code modular and logically simple named files
